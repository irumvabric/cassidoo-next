Hi! I'm Cassidy, and I like to make memes and dreams and software!

I'm the CTO at [Contenda](https://contenda.co), building [Brainstory](https://www.brainstory.ai/)! I'm also a startup advisor and investor, developer experience expert, and meme-maker on the internet. I enjoy building mechanical keyboards, playing music, and teaching in my free time.

You should [subscribe to my newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), or play my word game, [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/?utm_campaign=blahg&utm_source=github)!
