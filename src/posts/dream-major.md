It's hard to pick a major sometimes. It's scary too. I mean, you're not DEFINITELY stuck with your choice for the rest of your life, if you don't like it. But imagine if you loved your choice from the start, and that you can get your dream job right out of college??

I feel like that kind of happened to me. I asked myself several questions, and the job I got for after graduation is exactly what I want to do with my life!

So, I thought I'd pass along those questions. Who knows, maybe you'll find something new about yourself.

1. I've always wondered what it would be like to do \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and I think it's interesting to me becauseÂ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
2. If I had to go back to school tomorrow, I'd major in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. My co-workers and friends always say I'm great at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
4. The thing I love most about my current schoolwork/job/major is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
5. If I had the right skill set, I'd definitely try \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
6. If my parents/boss/roommate/manager/professor would let me, I'd do more of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
7. If I had a free Saturday that had to be spent just "working" on something, I'd choose \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
8. When I retire, I want to be known for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
9. If I could choose one friend to trade jobs/majors with, I'd choose \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

What'd you come up with?
