That's right, it's the **100th** [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/) puzzle!

I've already talked about [how I built it](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/jumblie-build-log/) and how I'm adding features here and there, so I'm not going to get into that.

Really, I'm just excited to celebrate this small milestone for my little game. It makes me so happy to see people playing it, and hearing that folks like it (especially when people say that their non-techie families play it, that is just the best).

Please do [submit your puzzle ideas](https://jumblie.com/suggest/)! I love seeing how clever some of them are, and I'm planning out more features around submissions and stuff, too.
