This looks fun, yes? It's a keyboard for your wrist. It wraps around your arm and has a standard QWERTY keyboard. It comes in green and blue and black and "smokey," and has glow-in-the-dark letters! It is built for harsh rain and weather conditions. Why you would be out in the rain with a keyboard around your wrist, I don't know. Oh wait, I just read the site again and it isn't rated yet for complete submersion in water. Darn.
