Hello my friends!

I hope you all had a splendid weekend, I sure did! I am here to tell you some thrilling news: Â My sister and I are going to speak at the White House!!!

We were told that we were invited early last week and of course we just had to say yes. We're not sure of all of the details of the event, but we know that we will be speaking about women in technology and computer science education, and that only six girls were chosen to go! It's super duper exciting, especially because we'll be able to represent the state of Iowa and Iowa State for the first time at such an event.

We're going this week, so plenty of pictures are to come! Have an AWESOME day!!
