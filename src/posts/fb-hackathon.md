Hey everyone!

So my friends and I were invited to the Facebook offices in Seattle for their Summer of Hack 24 hour Hackathon the other day. From Saturday 1PM to Sunday 1PM we had out our computers and just coded. It was SO fun! My friend Luis and I made a browser game where stars fall from the sky and you have to catch them, and you can tweet your score. Other people made things like Mac applications and collage designers!  It was so fun!  It took me FOREVER to recover from the lack of sleep though.

[Here's the code for our game!](https://github.com/cassidoo/Star-Catcher)

But, to make it all even more worth it, I got to walk away with a nice bundle of swag.![](/assets/fbswag.jpeg)
