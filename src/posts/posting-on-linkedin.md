I took a workshop that the LinkedIn team had about the best kinds of posts on the platform, so you don't have to! Here's some high level notes:

- [LinkedIn News](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/linkedin-news/) loves to amplify content if it's original/not just a link away from the platform (your content has to hit a quality bar to happen). It's okay to link away if there's a good amount of insight on LinkedIn itself.
- You should add questions when you end a post so that people engage with your content.
- Your first two lines of your posts have to be the engaging ones, don't bury the lede.
- When talking about events/talks/anything live, your "superpower" trick is to remember what it feels like to be in the audience and write about your perspective.
- When it comes to re-sharing content:
  - Share 1-3 insights
  - Give your point of view on what content says
  - Longer posts do better (at least 3 paragraphs), but short sentences _in_ the long post do even better.
  - Make sure the first two lines pull people in
- The best kind of content that gets re-shared and promoted:
  - Helps people get jobs
  - Helps people understand their industry or a trend in their industry
- If you post a video, make it 2 minutes or less, and make sure the text accompanying it is not too long (less than 100 words or so).
- If you really want to be "boosted" by _the algorithm_, try to post 3-4 times a week.
- People love polls. Add polls. Adding an "Other" option to a poll increases its visibility a bunch.

And this is a [good example post](<https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7003396408196165633/?updateEntityUrn=urn:li:fs_feedUpdate:(V2,urn:li:activity:7003396408196165633)>) that the LinkedIn team loves, that gets actual human boosts from their team!

Hope this is helpful!
