HAPPY PI DAY.
For those of you who don't know what Pi Day is, there's the number 3.14159265358979â€¦etc. which is a very significant number in all of our lives, and today, 3/14, CELEBRATES IT.

I've been celebrating Pi Day for many years now! I once memorized over 600 digits of pi to become 65th in the world and 18th for memorizing pi that year. I can still remember quite a few, but I'm out of practice.

ANYWAY, enjoy a slice of pie today, wear your favorite pi clothes (I am), and have a GREAT Pi Day!

Here's my outfit for the day if you need some inspiration:
