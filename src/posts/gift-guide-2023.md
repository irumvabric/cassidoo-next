I've bookmarked various things over the past year or so of things I would get for friends, family, and myself, and I thought I'd share 'em with ya after seeing [Chris Coyier's very cool guide](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/12/06/gift-guide-2023/)! Nobody's paying me to share these, I just think these are fun.

## Digital Things

I'm not talking about NFTs, just talking about things that are actually useful digital things! Mostly for nerds.

[Frontend Masters subscription](https://frontendmasters.com/)\
If you have friends learning to code or wanting to get better at it, I thought the FM courses were awesome.

[omg.lol subscription](https://omg.lol/)\
I got one of these recently ([check it out](https://cassidoo.omg.lol/)) and it's a really delightful service to make a little homepage, have email forwarding, and a bunch of other nice goodies.

[The Sukha Company pro subscription](https://www.thesukha.co/)\
I've mentioned this app before, it's a pomodoro timer + task list + focus music + digital coach app that has really helped my focus a lot (plus if you use code `CASSIDY` you get 20% off).

[CodePen Pro](https://codepen.io/features/pro)\
I really love CodePen in general, and this would be a great little gift for anyone who uses it.

[Brainstory subscription](https://www.brainstory.ai/)\
Okay I work on Brainstory so my credibility here is waning BUT it's a really great brainstorming app and I personally use it a ton (use code `ADVENT` for 20% off).

## Bags and wallets

I love things that contain things. If you ever aren't sure what to get me, just get me a cool bag or pouch or something.

[Secrid wallet](https://secrid.com/)\
I got my husband one of these a few years ago and it's so durable and useful, he gets compliments on it regularly!

[Analog Laptop Totes](https://analogcompany.co/en-us/collections/analog-laptop-tote)\
I really like how practical and well-made these are.

[Baboon to the Moon canvas tote](https://baboontothemoon.com/products/mega-canvas-tote?variant=39698386485319&sale=true)\
This brand is fairly pricey so I only really get things from them when they're on sale, but this canvas tote is **solid**. I have two and we use them both very often.

[Oceanbags: The Sunderbans](https://oceanbags.com/collections/all/products/the-sunderbans?variant=45432422072622)\
Anything that stops more plastic from getting into the ocean, I'm on board.

## Stuff for your desk

_Resisting making this entire section just all mechanical keyboards..._

[Carpio 2.0 ergonomic wrist rest](https://deltahub.io/products/carpio-ergonomic-wrist-rest)\
I like how subtle this one looks compared to other wrist rests I've seen before.

[Paper Republic Notebooks](https://www.paper-republic.com/en-us/collections/paper)\
I got one of these as a gift a while back and the paper is really delightful to write on!

[Scrabble keycaps](https://www.clackeys.com/scrabble)\
Okay, **yes** I designed these, but I also just love the look in general.

[Lord of the Rings Elvish keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/drop-the-lord-of-the-rings-elvish-keyboard?utm_source=linkshare&referer=EEA27B)\
This is a really unique board for your nerd friends.

[Muji pen set](https://www.muji.us/collections/pens/products/smooth-gel-ink-knock-type-ballpoint-pen-0-5mm-10-pieces-set-9a63)\
These pens are just so good. They're simple and look clean, and they write super well.

## Books

Support your local bookstores, but if you aren't able to, I tried to link to some shops that are good here!

[How to sew clothes](https://allwellworkshop.com/how-to-sew-clothes)\
I love that this one comes with patterns, too!

[The Mistborn Trilogy](https://www.abebooks.com/9781473213692/Mistborn-Trilogy-Final-Empire-Ascension-147321369X/plp)\
This series was **so** fun to read. The way I describe it quickly to folks is, "imagine Ocean's 11, but a fantasy adventure story." It starts as a heist and spirals from there!

[Think Again](https://adamgrant.net/book/think-again/)\
I read this book a couple years ago and I reference it to this day. I genuinely think most people should read it.

## Beverage things

I've become kind of a tea snob lately (especially after learning about microplastics in tea bags, ugh) so... join me in being a tea snob.

[Purple clay teapots](https://zishacraftsman.com/collections/all)\
I don't have one of these but whew, they're fancy lookin. Someday!

[Jumbo glass tea cup and infuser](https://www.adagio.com/teaware/jumbo_cup_and_infuser.html)\
My friend Ann got me one of these and I've used it... every single day since. It's a really great cup (made from borosilicate glass so it can handle high temps), and the infuser is perfect for any loose leaf teas you might like.

[Sardine cup](https://shop.visitlisboa.com/products/cup-2)\
I really like this green color and the little sardine art on it is just so cute.

[Once Upon a Time "fairy tale" tea](https://gildedcoach.com/products/once-upon-a-time)\
I haven't tried this but a friend of mine swears by it. This brand has edible glitter in it (did not know that was a thing) so your tea is shiny and fun.

[Hot chocolate velvetizer](https://us.hotelchocolat.com/collections/velvetiser-hot-chocolate-maker)\
Probably the most extra appliance I own (my friend Jason got it for me) and yet... it's spectacular and I am now a hot chocolate snob as well.

## Other stuff

[Mr. Jones watches](https://us.mrjoneswatches.com/)\
These are so artsy and fun for the analog lover in your life.

[Pocket Tripod](https://pocket-tripod.com/)\
My friend Tom recommended this one to me and it's great if you wanna take a non-selfie and adjust where your phone is sitting!

[Frank Lloyd Wright: Timeless art](https://spoke-art.com/collections/frank-lloyd-wright-timeless)\
I love Frank Lloyd Wright architecture in general, and the art prints here are a really cool homage to his work.

[Rosanna Tasker art](https://www.rosannatasker.com/shop/giclee-prints)\
I love this artist's style in how she draws plants!

[Canvas board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/290236/canvas)\
A friend of mine introduced me to this game a couple months ago and I bought it instantly. If you like board games, imagine a combo of [7 Wonders](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders) and [Century: Spice Road](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209685/century-spice-road), but in this one, you make pretty art!

## Goodbye

I don't know how people usually end gift guides so... _aggressively points finger guns while backing away_
