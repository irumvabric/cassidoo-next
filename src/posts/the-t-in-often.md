It is common to pronounce the letter "T" in the word often. I must say this is a huge pet peeve of mine.

The stem word for often is "oft" -- in which the t is pronounced. But when the ending "en" is added, the t sound is lost (though it remains in the spelling). There are, in fact, MANY examples of this sort of shift in English and in every other case the t becomes silent when followed by an -en or -le.


For example, soft (pronounced) vs. soften (silent).


More examples:

* list -> listen
* glisten
* fast \[as in 'held secure'] -> fasten
* haste -> hasten
* moist -> moisten
* nest -> nestle
* castle; mistletoe; whistle; trestle; gristle; thistle

Unfortunately, so many people started to pronounce the "t" that many regard is as an acceptable alternative, in certain dialects. That's the way language goes, I suppose, if enough people make the same mistake for long enough that it is no longer a mistake!
