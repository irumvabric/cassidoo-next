Hey friends!

So, I think you're really good looking.

You deserve the best.

So, I wanted to share with you my three favorite 2013 Mashups so far! I love mashup songs, the combination and layering of different music is my favorite to listen and study to!

[Pop Danthology 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJMapA8WgYw): The artist here, Daniel Kim, makes my favorite yearly mashups by far. In this one, he combined 68+ songs from this year to bring you this!

[DJ Earworm's United State of Pop 2013 (Living the Fantasy)](https://soundcloud.com/dj_earworm/united-state-of-pop-2013-living-the-fantasy): I don't usually listen to DJ Earworm, but this is probably my favorite of his yearly mashups yet! It's really epic sounding group of 25 songs from this year.

[#AnDyWuMUSICLAND Mashup 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2jWmB5Uy0g): This one is SUPER fun. It might be because I like that he included a Les Miserables song in there… along with 64 others!! Something also cool about this one is that he lined up not only the songs, but the lyrics too [(here's a link to them)](https://andywumusicland.tumblr.com/post/69081318879/andywumusicland-mashup-2013-best-60-pop-songs).

So, I hope you enjoy the end of your 2013 school year, and I can't wait to see you all again in 2014!
