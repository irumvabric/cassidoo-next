Hey everyone!!

Right now I'm at the [Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in Baltimore, Maryland!! I got sponsorship from Microsoft to go and so far I'm having SO MUCH FUN. I have some friends here who came with me last year and also my sister! They got sponsorship through the Iowa State Computer Science department.

This morning we had our welcome in the Baltimore Convention Center, it was super glamorous.

Throughout the day we have seminars and sessions and later a career fair full of tech companies. It's an awesome way to network with people and really celebrate women in computing!

So while you may be enjoying the lovely Midwest, I'll be here in the humid East for the next week!!

SEE YA!
