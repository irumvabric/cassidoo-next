Hey. You're looking ravishing as always.

Sometimes when I'm working hard over several hours on homework, it's hard to stay motivated to keep going. It's then that I try to listen to advice that people have given me to keep me working.

Here's some of that advice, for you.

"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."
Steve Jobs

"No matter what you do, you'll make it through. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. The thing they don't tell you is that it nearly kills you."
Tyler Arnold

"Life's too short to be stuck in a job you hate."
Kathryn Minshew

"If you really want to know where your destiny lies, look at where you apply your time. Time is the most valuable asset you don't own. You may or may not realize it yet, but how you use or don't use your time is going to be the best indication of where your future is going to take youâ€¦ Don't follow your passions, follow your effort. It will lead you to your passions and to success, however you define it."
Mark Cuban

"Do what you say you're going to do."
Danielle LaPorte

"Work hard and be nice to people."
Marie Burns

"In chaos, there is opportunity. Most major career accelerations happen when someone steps into a mess and makes a difference."
Kristi Hedges

"You can do this. You wouldn't be given all the work in front of you if you couldn't do it. Also I think you're hot."
Cassidy Williams
